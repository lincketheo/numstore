# Conventions

- All methods meant to be interfaces are preceeded with `i_`.
    - Bob Martin would be mad, but:
        1. It discourages interfaces / abstraction
        2. There really is only 1 abstraction in this code base - os
        3. It tells the programmer, hey this is an abstraction
- TODOs
    - TODO:OPT - Optimization
