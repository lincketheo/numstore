Ideas
- When I burn my brain out.
  - I could think so deeply this morning. My brain could travel paths below and navigate through chasms of logic. Logic. It's a tool that allows us to control the world. My world is this code. My world is this code base and the nested logic and the systems that I invented. I invented a world in this code. My code is a model of my brain. The constant contributions, followed by periods of cleanup and refactoring. Sometimes I write in Go, then re write in C. I feel this is a waste of time, but it's a refinement. A refinement of logic. I'm a logic perfectionist. I had a period of my life when I loved math where I sought to understand the world _perfectly_. I sought to understand systems deep down and they interact with each other. Now, I find that a detterrent. People tell me that this way of thinking slows you down, but for me, it's how a carpenter polishes his tools. He revistist his work, polishes it, makes it better. I polish my logic, I polish my tools, my logic and my mind and my mental models are my tool. My mental models do not fit in the sense of the world. Get out. Get out of the thoughts and the thought process of the world. Get out and think freely. Build models in your mind. I must break from this layer of abstraction. This prison I put myself in.
