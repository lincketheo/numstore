    Numstore is a numerical data storage engine — a fully featured Database Management System (DBMS) designed for
    numerical or “signal-like” data. Where traditional DBMS platforms evolved to handle business records, transactional
    integrity, and text-centric schemas, Numstore directly targets raw binary arrays, typed primitives, and the large
    sequential datasets common in scientific computing, sensor networks, and modern machine learning pipelines.
