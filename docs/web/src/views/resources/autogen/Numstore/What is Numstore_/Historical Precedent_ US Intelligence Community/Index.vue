  <p>In the U.S. defense and intelligence community, one can look at the X-Midas<Cite key-id="x-midas"/> (XMIDAS) file
    format, developed as part
    of the X-Midas signal processing environment, as an example of a domain-specific data storage solution. XMIDAS was
    designed for high-rate sampled signals, with metadata describing sample rates, channelization, and processing
    history . These formats highlight a broader pattern: general-purpose relational databases rarely serve well in the
    context of streaming or multidimensional signal data, so specialized engines and file formats have repeatedly been
    developed.</p>
