- Make the enemy completely "right" - but do bad things

## The Neurogene

Interface with your fingers in a webbed box, controlling strings and letting the machine figure out semantic meaning. 

Society is logical. 
- Who decides what the cost function is?
- People need to build models for this cost function.
- Need data to feed into the web 
- Need to process that data 
- Lower class 
- Evil class wants to return back to their human forms

People didn't physically evolve, but we forced ourselves to evolve based on logic and our jobs. Our minds got so deep in the neurogene that we are our logical formulation of ourselves. The same way programming languages are so different from one another.
    - Claritects 
        - programmers, crafters of logic. Builders, gifted logicians
        - Over time they've grown to become perfectionists, 
          leaving progress behind, but that theme doesn't present 
          itself till the end - how they're "wrong"
    - Illuminants - more of explorers who explore complex logic and math and pictures
        - Come up with new ideas
        - Have been driven away from claritects.
    - Lepidopts
        - 1 layer above formicans - data processing 
        - They turn numbers into statistical formula / models
    - Formicans - colectors of data 
        - Scrounge the web to find data to feed back to the claritects  
        - They collect the numbers
    - Aranea - lower class 
        - No ability to build - just scrape along the web 
    - Vespinae
    - Aranea ("Spiders")
    - Formicans ()
