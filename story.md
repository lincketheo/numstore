I did it again. I trapped myself in this prison. This morning, I was a genius... now I'm burnt out. My mind is racing but it can only think 1 layer deep. This morning I could think 5, 10, no 20 layers deep. Now I'm stuck. But my arms weave through the water, splashing the air above. The dichotomy of the water and the air intriques me. 

Abstraction is my cell. 

Jake's eyes opened, looking at the baby blue backdrop of the painted clouds. The color reminded him of his childhood. His baby blue toys and thoughts of his mother.. his once happy exterior. His feet rested against the railing. It was cold to the touch. It sent a sharp tingle up his skin. Watching cars drive beneath him, watching children skip, and mothers calmly holding 

He reached for his table and picked up his computer. His fingers lay still against the keyboard. Ideas are a dime a dozen these days. Time, labor, captial, those are easy, but ideas are subject to our mental chips. He started typing:

```
const priorities = [
    
];
```

Hmm, it's a start. What do I want? Happiness I guess. Isn't that what they all say? Jake got distracted by the child bolting out underneath his balcony. Why do children play? Why did I play? Should I chase fun? No, I need a career no? 

```
const priorities = [
    "Build a career",
    "Find a wife",
    "Have sex",
    "Be happy"
];
```

Jake smiled. If only it were that easy. 

```

```

His neurogene began whirring. No, no, no. Let's try again. What do I need right now? 

```
const priorities = [

```

# Summary 

A fantasy world. Never reveal the date.

Jobs
    - Coders

Knowledge is used as wealth. People upgrade their brains and enter higher classes, but in general, all struggle is solved so poverty isn't a thing, the real problem is navigating our emotions, so it's not always the best idea to upgrade because "ignorance is bliss". Once you upgrade, it's impossible to downgrade due to the technical debt. Some people have tried (have a short section in the book about a character who tries) but it always ends up wrong because once you see the world in a certain way, it's almost impossible to go back. Upgrading your brain means attaching more compute and having a deeper layer of logic capability. 

What I need is a world, kind of like tolkein's fantasy world, but grounded in the idea that humans can now program their brains. 


Main character is one of the only people who attempted a downgrade. Navigating in the world of humans with less knowledge - he's a good person. about someone who downgraded his brain and lives a layer below. Navigating the world

Ryen's eyes were closed. His neurogene flickered in front of him through his eyelids, but he had entered his inhibitor code earlier so it didn't distract him. 

Layer 1. Scan your surroundings. 

Ryen began his normal layer 1 ritual. Cleanup. His father had taught him an important lesson. When you don't know what to do, clean your room. It was a stupid saying, but it helped him navigate his layer 2 dreams a little bit more confidently. He scanned layer 1. The familiar feeling of overwhelem engulfed him, but he didn't feel overwhelemed. His mind fell upon a long chain of logic that didn't make any sense. Clean your room. 

One word at a time, focus on each word, then each line, then each block. His hands reached in front of him to his neurogene interface. It was a way of entering commands. 

The neurogene interface worked like a spider's web. First, you stick your fingers into the chain of silky threads interweaved together, entangled in a random pattern of lines and curls. While the neurogene was plugged in through your temple, it understood what you wanted, and needed. It only took a couple of days to adapt the movements of your hand to thought patterns in your chip. To add a new thought, command, query, whatever you would move your fingers in whatever way felt best. There were no perscribed patterns, just a short feedback loop. It learned quickly, and usually one fell into patterns and never really changed them. 

Ryen swooped his hand in a familiar pattern of arches. It was 10 years past the move from physical interfaces to the string interface. Those who had experienced the physical realm often matched patterns from the physical realm into their own string realm. Deleting logic took a sweeping motion. When you were connected to the ehter, greeting people sometimes looked like you were waving. But those who had been born into this world had no notion of the physical realm. They often invented their own pattern of movements. 

There was a moth in Zin's inner weapons system. Planted there by the greens.

# Neurogene Hacking Tactics
- Distraction
    - Lose focus of the task you're working on in place of something shiny
- Pleasure
    - Similar to distraction - porn, videos etc.
- Weardown
    - Make you think / navigate a deep chasm of logic to tire your head out

Your house is your head. 
Hook up your physical reactions to your house.
- Program your pleasure to be tied to 

- Jobs / distinguishing things

We've gotten so good at transplating thought - we all originated from humans, but it was the abstractions that we build and fell into. We evolve in a way that we fall into the abstractions we wrote - leading to different species. 
    - Lower class 
        - Spiders - crawl the web, have a surface understanding of navigation - can navigate the global web really well
    - Middle class 
        - adsda
    - "Good" upper class 
        - Logical wizards - purifiers - builders of clean logical structures. Coders - the perfectionist - perfectionism gets in the way, time and effort causes lower / middle class to struggle and constantly catch up. Spent too much time 
    - Evil upper class faction 
        - Trying to return back to their human forms

Lower Classes (Surface Navigators)
Formicans ("Ants")

    Abilities:
    Collective logic and hive communication; specialize in repetitive, labor-intensive cognitive tasks.

    Jobs & Roles:

        Scrubbers: Maintain purity of low-level data streams, performing routine cleanups.

        Assemblers: Piece together fragmented lower-layer knowledge into stable packages.

    Traits: Disciplined, collective-driven, but lack creativity.

Lepidopts ("Butterflies")

    Abilities:
    Visual and sensory data specialists, able to rapidly interpret and communicate aesthetic data.

    Jobs & Roles:

        Pattern Scouts: Locate and extract visually significant data to sell to Artisans.

        Sensorial Merchants: Trade emotional or sensory-rich snippets to upper classes.

    Traits: Artistic, expressive, but superficial in their logic comprehension.

Middle Classes (Deep Network Specialists)
Coleopterans ("Beetles")

    Abilities:
    Robust defensive coding; masters at protecting data integrity and structure.

    Jobs & Roles:

        Firewall Engineers: Build defenses around key logical constructs, preventing unwanted intrusion.

        Integrity Keepers: Monitor mid-level logic layers for inconsistencies or breaches.

    Traits: Reliable, steadfast, but resistant to innovation.

Mantodeans ("Mantises")

    Abilities:
    Highly adept at precision logic pruning and targeted cognitive strikes.

    Jobs & Roles:

        Cognitive Assassins: Target and neutralize corrupted logic nodes or hostile cognitive intrusions.

        Precision Debuggers: Surgically remove damaging logical threads from critical thought structures.

    Traits: Precise, deadly accurate, but morally ambiguous.

Lower Class (Surface Navigators)
Species Name: Aranea ("Spiders")

    Abilities: Surface-level agility, rapid traversal of vast informational networks.

    Jobs & Roles:

        Webscouts: Explorers and data couriers who quickly traverse superficial layers, delivering urgent messages.

        Pathweavers: Connect fragmented layers of lower logic, maintaining the stability and flow of baseline information.

        Harvesters: Gather raw, unsorted data from shallow network depths to feed upward to higher classes.

    Traits: Quick, resourceful, but limited in deeper understanding. Thrive on instinct rather than deep logic.

Middle Class (Deep Network Specialists)
Species Name: Vespinae ("Wasps")

    Abilities: Skilled at intermediate-level analytics, capable of constructing moderately complex logical structures.

    Jobs & Roles:

        Data Architects: Design reliable yet relatively straightforward logic patterns and intermediate storage structures.

        Logic Moderators: Filter, monitor, and police the mid-level cognitive highways, controlling data access between classes.

        Cognitive Merchants: Trade structured knowledge and modular logic patterns to lower classes, profiting off selective abstraction.

    Traits: Pragmatic, efficient, but neither driven nor burdened by perfectionism. The backbone of commerce and interaction, yet dependent on upper-class architects.

Upper Class ("Good" Logical Architects)
Species Name: Logomancers ("Logical Wizards")

    Abilities: Mastery of high-level abstractions, constructing pure and flawlessly elegant logic-structures. Strive for perfection.

    Jobs & Roles:

        Codex Architects: Design pristine, robust structures of knowledge that underpin all stable societal abstractions.

        Purifiers: Identify, cleanse, and repair corrupted logic or intrusive cognitive weapons within deep-layer structures.

        Patternsmiths: Develop new logical languages, algorithms, and cognitive frameworks, always refining toward perfect elegance.

    Traits: Idealistic, obsessive, and meticulous to the point of impracticality. Their pursuit of logical purity often inadvertently creates hardship for lower classes, who struggle to adapt quickly enough to the ever-more-complex frameworks.

Upper Class (Evil/Antagonist Faction)
Species Name: Anthroparians ("Those Who Seek Humanity")

    Abilities: Deeply skilled logicians who aim to reverse-engineer their advanced abstractions and return to baseline human cognition, but often employ ruthless methods.

    Jobs & Roles:

        Devolutionists: Create and deploy cognitive weapons that strip away layers of abstraction, forcefully returning others toward simpler, often traumatizing states.

        Biohackers: Implant malicious logic-pathogens designed to disrupt or simplify the mind, sometimes destroying identities in the process.

        Entropists: Engineers of chaos, intentionally fracturing stable logic patterns to accelerate societal collapse toward primitive emotional states.

    Traits: Nihilistic, destructive, driven by nostalgic obsession with original human simplicity. They consider forced regression a liberation, despite catastrophic consequences for those unprepared.
















Humans program their minds like computer programs.



A sleek black label strapped against the box said "Neurogene v502.207.1". 

"Is it new?" Jake asked. The attendant pulled out his glasses from his shirt pocket and with a shaky hand, placed them on the tip of his nose. 

"Erm... I think so. Last time I checked we were on a hund'ed something" 

Jake picked it up and moved it around in the air. The neurogene was usually compatible with most version 201 brains, but you had to be careful. Sometimes companies would force upgrades. Upgrades were costly, but more importantly, the surgeon was usually sponsored. Surgeons were usually good people, but the constant pull of sales from people around them forced them to make decisions they wouldn't have made without prior agreements. This one looked like it was compatible. Thank god. Jake only knew a handful of version 202-ers. Although usually once you make the upgrade, there's no real point in interacting with people with a brain lower than yours. Sometimes 

Jake’s fingers brushed the cool metal casing of the box as he turned it over, reading the tiny engraved license number stamped beside the label: “NVG-2119-AX.” Fluorescent shop lights glinted off its edges. The attendant—an older man whose thinning hair caught stray light like a halo—cleared his throat.

“Sometimes,” the attendant continued, voice trailing off, "companies patch the firmware quietly between major releases. You might think you’re getting a hundred‑series upgrade, but five weeks later you find out they slipped in a security patch that only works on 203 brains."

Jake arched an eyebrow. “So this could brick me if I’m not careful?”

The attendant adjusted his glasses, peering at a glowing handheld scanner. “Brick” was a strong word, but true. “It’ll limp along, if at all. You’ll lose peripheral sync, maybe hallucinate faint static when you try to recall memories. At worst, your cortex runs a half‑baked initialization loop. Believe me, I’ve seen folks go catatonic.” He sighed, returning the scanner to its charging dock. “But this one? I ran a quick compatibility check. Looks clean.”

Jake thought for a while.
