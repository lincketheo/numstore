# Setting:
Long long ago, humans built the neurogene, a device that plugs into your biological "outlets" allowing you to program your body. Advancements were made over time, slowly trapping humans in caskets plugged into their neurogenes. We started to evolve in our minds by falling into the abstractions that we produced. Over time, logomancers became a popular term for developers. 

In this internal world, we exist as creatures of different species. Species are abstractions we fell into. No human has died since 2045, cyber beings live in their world as immortals and a different notion of evolution is a thing. We fully expect to evolve into different species over time. We can merging identities

- Web crawlers. Live on the frindges of logical barriers. No true identity
