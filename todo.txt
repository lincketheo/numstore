--- REFACTORS ---

- cmplx > cmplx and other binary expressions are not allowed 
  in python. Right now I'm just doing it. Take those out and 
  fix tests 
    - Hotspots: literal.c

----------------
--- FEATURES ---
----------------

- Support backslash in strings for special characters

--- BUGS ---
------------

1. Deal with empty strings in the scanner

   Right now it reads in a string and when it 
   transfers that string to the working memory of the parser,
   it encounters an ASSERT(str.len > 0). I think empty strings 
   should be supported, but I don't want to just slap a NULL on it 
   and be good

2. Fix broken tests in scanner.c 
   - I know they should work if you just allocate a statement before 
     but I want to get them to work without a statement.
      - Add a test with unallocated statement 
        Shouldn't block (blocks now)
