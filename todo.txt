- Statement allocation context refactor
  Get statements to be in control of compiler allocations rather than queries so that 
  we can support embedded queries in the future.
  1. Remove qalloc from query
  2. Create statement and get AST working
  3. Refactor query_provider to allocate statements instead of queries
  4. Refactor compiler to allocate to the correct places 

- Support backslash in strings for special characters

--- BUGS ---
------------

1. Deal with empty strings in the scanner

   Right now it reads in a string and when it 
   transfers that string to the working memory of the parser,
   it encounters an ASSERT(str.len > 0). I think empty strings 
   should be supported, but I don't want to just slap a NULL on it 
   and be good

2. The 2 char token test is failing because my logic is wrong 
   
   Step through it and fix it
